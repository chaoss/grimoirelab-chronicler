title: Event ID generation for Git actions updated
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  Commits containing multiple copy file actions for the same file
  generated duplicate event IDs because the new file name wasnâ€™t
  included in the ID calculation.
