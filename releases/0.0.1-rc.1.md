## grimoirelab-chronicler 0.0.1-rc.1 - (2025-01-15)

The chronicler is a command line tool and a library that converts items
generated by Perceval into events. The tool reads these events from the
standard input or from a given file.

To run it, you will have to give the type of items the chronicler is
receiving with DATASOURCE argument (e.g. git, github, gitlab).

Output is produced using JSON format.
